# ✅ Cypress Gherkin Tests – TodoMVC App

This project automates **functional tests** for the [TodoMVC React App](https://todomvc.com/examples/react/dist/) using **Cypress** + **Cucumber (Gherkin syntax)**.

---

## 📌 Step 1 – Tested Functionalities

The following features were tested:

- Add new tasks
- Mark tasks as completed
- Filter tasks (`All`, `Active`, `Completed`)
- Clear completed tasks

---

## 📌 Step 2 – Positive Scenarios

- Add a new todo
- Mark items completed and check counter
- Edit an existing todo
- Delete a todo

📂 File: `cypress/e2e/features/positive.feature`

---

## 📌 Step 3 – Negative Scenarios

- Do not accept duplicate todos
- Do not allow overly long todos
- Editing a todo to empty does not overwrite it
- Do not delete a todo without user action

📂 File: `cypress/e2e/features/negative.feature`
